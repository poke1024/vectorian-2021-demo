This Sin faln Man raise-up t'integrity, Or rase Me out from Heav'ns society. What though He sinned? alas He was but Earth! Though dead in Sin? thy Grace can give new birth! Though grieved with pains? O thou canst 'ford him ease! Though Hell gape for Him? thou canst Hell appease! Thou mad'st Him Thee to bless eternally: But damned Souls curse everlastingly.
