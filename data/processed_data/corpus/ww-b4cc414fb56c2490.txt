You have had many a thought of it, and bestowed many a day's labour for it, and yet do you not know it? O but you never saw it for all this? Answ. It is a spiritual Blessedness that Flesh and Blood can neither enjoy nor see: But by the eye of the Mind you have often seen, at least some glimpse of it; You know that it is the present intuition and full fruition of God himself and your glorified Redeemer with his blessed Angels and Saints in perfect Love, and Joy, and Praise. And if you know this, you are not altogether Strangers to Heaven.
