[Rodorigo:] Why should such plants as you are, pleasure's children That owe their blushing years to gentle objects, Tenderly bred, and brought up in all fulness, Desire the stubborn wars? [Marcantonio:] In those 'tis wonder, That make their ease their god, and not their honour: But noble General, my end is other, Desire of knowledge Sir, and hope of tying Discretion to my time, which only shows me, And not my years, a man, and makes that more. Which we call handsome, the rest is but boys' beauty, And with the boy consumed.
