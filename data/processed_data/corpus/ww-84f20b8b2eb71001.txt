[Canutus:] Thou'st spoke enough to damn thee, Impudent Traitor, go die unpitied; Though thou hast my hate, thou shalt not have the honour of my sword to take away thy life, you of our Guard; See a base death performed upon this Slave. [Captain:] Farewell my Liege you once must have a grave. (Exit with Guard.) [Harold:] My Resolution's firm, and I will speak, though hell should gape to swallow me alive; What's he that's gone to death my Sovereign? [Canutus:] Traytor (Harold) to my best content.
