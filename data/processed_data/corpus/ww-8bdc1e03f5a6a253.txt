Alas, poor Book, hunt not thou after praise, Nor dare to stretch thy hand unto the Bays Upon a Poets head: let it suffice To thee and me, the world doth us despise. For 'tis a mad World, and it turns on hinges, Whilst some a-birding go, and set their springes For to catch Woodcocks. Others sting and bite Like Wasps and Mastiffs, and do take delight To quarrel with their shadows, nay, themselves, And their own brood.
