I have a fine bow, and an ivory arrow: And if thou miss, yet meat thou shalt lack, I'll hang a bag and bottle at thy back. Wilt thou set springs in a frosty Night, To catch the long-billed Woodcock and the Snipe? (By the bright glimmering of the Starry light) The Partridge, Phaesant, or the greedy Crype?
