[Lyonel:] [...] (Sings) There's nothing so fatal as Woman, To hurry a Man to his Grave, You must think, you may plot, You may sigh like a Sot: She uses you more like a Slave. But a Bottle, although it be common, The Cheats of the Fair will undo, It will drive from your Head The Delights of the Bed; He that's drunk is not able to woo. (Exit Lyonel) [Celia:] Method in Madness, Grace even in Distraction: I'll never leave him, 'till, by Art or Prayer, I have restored his Senses to their Office.
