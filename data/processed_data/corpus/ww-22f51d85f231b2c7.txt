Yet went I to his Work the furthest way: And, travelled, as mine own occasions lay. Which he perceiving, sent a Storm that crest me; Made shipwreck of my hopes; my labour lost me; Befooled my wisdom; of much joy bereft me; Within the Sea of many troubles left me; And what with speed and ease I might have done At first; hath long with pain been lingered on.
