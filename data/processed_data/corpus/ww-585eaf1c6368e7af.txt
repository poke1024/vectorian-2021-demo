[Clown:] If there be any man that wants a name, will come in for conscience sake, and acknowledge himself to be a Whore-Master, he shall have that laid to his charge in an hour, he shall not be rid on in an age; if he have Lands, he shall have an heir, if he have patience, he shall have a wife, if he have neither Lands nor patience, he shall have a whore, so ho boy, so ho, so, so. [Prince Uter (within):] So, ho, by, so, ho, illo ho, illo ho. [Clown:] Har, hark sister, there's one hollows to us, what a wicked world's this, a man cannot so soon name a whore but a knave comes presently, and see where he is, stand close a while, sister.
