I find my growing Judgement daily instructs me how to be better, but my untamed affections and confirmed vitiosity makes me daily do worse; I find in my confirmed age the same sins I discovered in my youth, I committed many then because I was a child, and because I commit them still I am yet an Infant. Therefore I perceive a man may be twice a child before the days of dotage, and stand in need of Aeson's bath before threescore.
