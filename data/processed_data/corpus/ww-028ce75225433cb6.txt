Now fie upon him! what is Man, Whose life at best is but a span? When to an Inch it dwindles down, Ice in his bones, Snow on his crown, That he within his crazy brain, Kind thoughts of Love should entertain, That he, when Harvest comes should plow, And when 'tis time to reap, go sow, Who in imagination only strong, Though twice a Child, can never twice grow young.
