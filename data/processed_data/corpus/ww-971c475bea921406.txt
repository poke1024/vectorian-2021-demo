[King:] Tomorrow Guise is made Lieutenant-General, Why then tomorrow I no more am King; 'Tis time to push my slackened vengeance home, To be a King, or not to be at all; The Vow that manacled my Rage is loosed, Even Heaven is wearied with repeated Crimes, Till lightning flashes round to guard the Throne, And the curbed Thunder grumbles to be gone.
