[Gondarino:] My Lord, I speak not this to gain new grace, But howsoever you esteem my words, My love and duty will not suffer me To see you favour such a prostitute, And I stand by dumb; without Rack, Torture, Or Strappado, I'll unrip myself, I do confess I was in company with that pleasing peace of frailty, that we call woman; I do confess after along and tedious siege, I yielded.
