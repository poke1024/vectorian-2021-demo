[Ephraim:] But sir, beware you fall not back again Into your childish follies: but go forwards In manly actions, for non progredi id est regredi. [Nehemiah:] I know the meaning of that too, Ephraim: that's once a man and twice a child. But if I turn child again, while I have teeth in my head, I'll give Mistress Blith leave to dig 'em out with sugar plums, as she almost did these two of 'em yesterday, with her knuckles.
